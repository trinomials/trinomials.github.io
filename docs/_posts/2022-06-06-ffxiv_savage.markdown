Up until recently, I had been playing FFXIV essentially solo. Most hard content is gated behind a party of 8 players, and I did not have access to that. I joined a static and these are my initial thoughts on raiding in a static environment.

We started with Eden 8 Savage unsynced as a test of cooperative skill. After two or three attempts we cleared, and went on to try E9S. The mechanics of E8S were very similar to the normal fight, with additional mechanics and harder versions of skills. It ended up being significantly more fun than I had anticipated and I am now hooked on raiding. At the time of writing, my static is progging P3S.

## Individual raid breakdowns

# Endsinger

I had heard rumors that this fight would be more difficult than the previous two extremes for Endwalker. After 2 hours of prog with my static, I joined party finder practice groups and cleared on my own time. Once I had mechanics down, I was able to clear consistently.

My favorite mechanics from this fight were Twinsong's Aporrhoia and Elegeia Unforgotten. These were the easiest for me to figure out, and had uptime strategy that I did not see others use often. In Elegeia Unforgotten, red planets will collide on intercardinals. Since the AOE has a radius of about 75% the radius of the arena, no matter which intercardinal it happens at, you can stand on the opposite EW edge of the platform. NW and SW collisions leave a safe spot at E and vice versa for NE and SE. As long as the head in the center isn't facing that spot, you are free to get uptime. In Twinsong's Aporrhoia, the optimal position is guaranteed by modular arithmatic. The center head, having 4 options, isn't affected by the mod2 for the other 4 heads, which have 2 options each. Upon time reversal, there are a few rules which always lead to quick deduction of the safe area:

1. If the middle head is 3, then the safe area is opposite the previous safe area
2. If the middle head is 2, then the safe area is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees
3. If an outer head has 1 or 3 (which are equivalent in mod2), the safe spot doesn't change from what it just was

In each safe spot, the edge of the donut AOE is always close enough for melee uptime as it is within 5 yalms of the boss. Overall, this fight was decently difficult to learn but most mechanics are easy once learned. It also requires situational awareness and prepositioning for overlapping Elegeia Unforgottens.

# P1S

This fight is certainly easier than Endsinger EX. The mechanics are simpler and no sprinting is required in most cases. It closely follows the normal fight with a few additional mechanics and an overhauled Intemperance. I don't have much to say about this fight as it is mechanically similar to the base fight. My most major concern was dying from the tank-swapping, double tank-buster, and wasting my Superbolide in case the tank swap was missed.

# P2S

I am not particularly great at this fight, considering I have not learned the proper way to do the third Channeling Overflow. The rest of the fight is easy enough, and requires a lot more well-timed mitigation and KB resist. This fight is also the fight that got me to care about perfecting my rotation. As it was, I had a general idea of how to play GNB, and had the level 80 rotation still in muscle memory. I've trained for hours outside my FC house to get my rotation perfect. After failing to pass the enrage check, I decided it was a good use of time to actually play well and help carry my part of the load of needed damage. I passed the training dummy test fight for this, P3S and P4S before feeling confident enough to do P2S. I do think it generally helped my damage to go up, and even got me using tincture of strength and caring about my BiS. I could not pass the DPS check dummy for P4S without food and an initial tincture. 

There are certain attack that reward prepositioning. It is a good idea to always stay opposite from the instant death corner of the flooded arena. This minimizes the distance needed to dodge out of the way of skills that can target any corner. As a tank, I can preposition my KB spread AOE from Cataract, and generally reach the safe zone and have time to stand still without having to worry about wiping the party. Prepositioning for double tank stack means we can spend less time avoiding hitting the non-tanks. For Shockwave, we can position in two Light Parties before the KB hits, and not have to worry about moving after.

I don't have enough experience in P3S to post a thorough opinion on the fight just yet, and E8S and E9S don't really count for my raiding experience as we bumbled through them at best, being carried by unsync and the echo.
